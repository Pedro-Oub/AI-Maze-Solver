Hello and welcome to my project.

Using Kruskal's algorithm I was able to build a maze of any size always with a solution. 
Then, using A* algorithm the maze is solved.
The initial, unsolved maze is then produced using matplotlib and a second maze is prompted, this time with its solution.
Other maze builders and algorithms have also been added to the program but are excluded from the main code.
The user is free to play with these algorithms by inserting them inside the main code to see how they work.
